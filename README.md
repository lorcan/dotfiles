# dotfiles
I'm using [RCM](http://thoughtbot.github.io/rcm/) to manage my dotfiles.

I wouldn't recommend reusing these, much better to write your own.

## Instructions
Before beginning you will need to install git, vim, zsh, [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and rcm.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/lorcan/dotfiles.git
rcup -d dotfiles -v -x README.md 
```
